### 1-Description
This project was a result of a conversation about missed movies and events. You go to a movie and see a preview for a movie that looks AWESOME and you can't wait to see it, but, unfortunately, you're going to have to because the release date is a vague and distant "Summer 2017". You make a mental note of it and lean over and tell your friend you can't wait to see that one on the big screen. Then you move on with life, and before you know it, "Summer 2017" has come and gone and you completely forgot, and by the time you remember the movie, it's been out for months and is only available on Blu-Ray. 

Event Vaark lets you save your own curated list of movies and events you don't want to miss. It has an effective search function and a convenient "at-a-glance" list to serve you when memory fails to.

### 2-Technologies
  This project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Greensock.js](https://greensock.com/)
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- AJAX
- Web APIs
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Responsive Design

### 3-Challenges
The primary challenge presented by this project was Firebase. Firebase is an awesome tool if you need a simple storage solution, but it did take some time to figure out. Otherwise, this was a fairly straightforward project that just required time and persistence to work through. AJAX request results are, I think, fun to work through and parse out into useful pieces, and the Greensock animations were fun as well.

### 4-Issues
  Currently there are no known issues that need to be resolved. If you find an issue please submit it using the issues tab, or contact [Keith Allmon](https://github.com/Strangebrewer/).
  
### 5-Future Development
Some additional features that could be useful or interesting for future development would include a notification system for when an event or ticket sales are coming up, and possibly linking to ticket sale services.
